### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**AbChatt/abchatt** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I'm Abhishek, a third year undergraduate who's passionate about using technology to drive societal change. I'm keenly interested in backend development and AI and love learning about new tech!

- ðŸ”­ If you're new around these parts, I'd recommend checking out the EcoSecure and SigmaCapital projects :) - some of my best work to date.
- âš¡ Fun fact: When I'm not poring over code, I train for cross-country runs. Hoping to run my first 10K this year!

Always interested in collaborating with others so feel free to reach out, even if its just to chat!
